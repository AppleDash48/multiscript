# multiscript
What have I created?! A Skidd's dream! Why? Well, because I'm bored, and I'm tired of having to type common commands.

First things first. I am in NO way, shape, or form, liable for anything that happens to you, your computer, or anything that comes about from you using this script.

Problems with the script? Contact me. Problems with your pc? Sure, why not. Personal problems? Eh, it depends, but you can try. Think you can help me out? Please, it's encouraged to contact me! Want to participate? Please, it's encouraged to contact me!

Legal issues you've gotten yourself into? Do not contact me.

I use these commands a lot in my line of work. (Plus some extras because I figured why not add them in) These are the kinds of commands that I've just gotten bored of constantly typing over and over again even though I've got them memorized by heart. Credit to the ideas go to the nullbyte wonderhowto forums. Definately go have a looksee at them.
